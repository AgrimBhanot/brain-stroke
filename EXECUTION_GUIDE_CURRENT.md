# Current Execution Guide

**Project:** EEG-based stroke-severity analysis from interhemispheric EEG asymmetry
**Status date:** 2026-10-21
**Authority:** This is the current operational guide. It reconciles the original phase plan, the completed legacy work, and the proposed Group A v2 feature track.

## 1. How agents must use this guide

1. Read this file and `AGENTS.md` before acting.
2. Confirm the current phase and required outputs exist before starting the next subphase.
3. Do only the active subphase unless this guide explicitly permits a dependency task.
4. Do not infer completion from prose. Verify files, shapes, finite values, tests, and logs on disk.
5. After each completed subphase, update `docs/PROGRESS.md` with the status, date, outputs, validation, and open issues.
6. Do not overwrite legacy v1 files or results while building v2.
7. If a required input is missing or a rule is ambiguous, mark the subphase `BLOCKED` and record the exact blocker. Do not silently improvise.

The historical ledgers preserve what happened. This guide and `docs/PROGRESS.md` describe what agents should do next.

## 2. Research scope and fixed facts

### 2.1 Goal

Evaluate whether EEG spectral asymmetry and graph/connectivity features contain useful information about stroke severity. The available Figshare cohort supports only binary classification:

- `mild`: NIHSS 1-4, 33 subjects
- `moderate`: NIHSS 5-11, 17 subjects
- `severe`: 0 subjects

The project cannot support a three-class severity conclusion with this cohort.

### 2.2 Legacy v1 state: complete and frozen

The original pipeline produced patient-level Figshare features and a baseline model. These files are reference inputs and must not be rewritten:

- `features/figshare_features.csv`: 50 subjects, labeled spectral table
- `features/figshare_patient_features.csv`: patient-level spectral table before final labels
- `features/figshare_graph_features.csv`: 50 subjects plus 16 v1 graph features
- `features/figshare_combined_features.csv`: legacy spectral-plus-graph table
- `src/train_models.py`: legacy modeling harness
- `src/graph_features.py`: legacy wPLI graph extractor

The legacy spectral benchmark was weak and unstable, close to the dummy baseline. The legacy graph features also showed epoch-count dependence, especially in `MeanHomotopic`. These are reasons for the v2 audit; they are not evidence that v2 will improve performance.

### 2.3 v2 objective

Build and validate new feature tables without using their relationship to labels during feature engineering:

- sign-invariant spectral asymmetry;
- lesion-aligned spectral asymmetry, only if lesion semantics are verified;
- fixed-epoch graph features on the clean 8-channel core;
- fixed-epoch graph features on an audited symmetric expanded channel set;
- label-free quality, bias, stability, and collinearity checks;
- frozen tables and a manifest for Group B evaluation.

The v2 work is **pre-specified exploratory analysis**, not a claim of improved prediction.

## 3. Non-negotiable agent rules

### R1: Prevent label leakage

Feature-building code must not read `nihss_raw` or `severity_class`. The only permitted clinical metadata access in Group A is `lesion_side` in the lesion-alignment step, and only after its semantics are verified. Feature engineering must not select channels, epochs, constants, or methods because of label associations.

### R2: Keep labels out of v2 feature files

Every v2 feature CSV contains `subject_id` and feature columns only. Labels and metadata belong in `features/v2/subject_meta.csv`. Sidecars must list the exact columns.

### R3: Preserve v1

Do not edit Phase 0-4 source files, legacy feature CSVs, or legacy result artifacts for v2. New implementation files use new names such as `src/*_v2.py`.

### R4: Use fixed, auditable configurations

All constants affecting v2 output belong in JSON config files saved under `configs/`. Record the config hash, source commit, date, channel list, band definitions, `N_fixed`, subsample count, and seeds in sidecars.

### R5: No unregistered label evaluation

Before any real-label v2 evaluation, Group B must freeze `docs/ANALYSIS_REGISTRY.md` and tag the registry. Real-label evaluation runs only through the registry harness. Tests may use synthetic or shuffled labels.

### R6: Statistical discipline

Do not tune repeatedly against the same labels. Report all registered tests, including failures, with the planned multiple-testing correction. Use the language `no effect detected`, not `no effect`.

### R7: Keep graph methods reproducible

Use fixed-size epoch sampling without replacement, deterministic per-subject seeds, a documented node order, explicit left/right pair mapping, and deterministic feature names.

### R8: Review before freeze

Before freeze, Agrim performs one authoritative project-owner review of the latest snapshot. No AI-model, model-family, Group A, or multi-review dependency is required. Earlier supplied reviews remain historical evidence only. The single active review must approve the exact final digest and acknowledge unresolved limitations. Ordinary coding proceeds without review collection; ask Agrim only at a real freeze or result-changing amendment boundary.

### R9: Escalate blockers

Missing metadata, uncertain lesion semantics, insufficient epochs, channel-quality failures, or library-equivalence failures are blockers to the affected subphase. Record them in `docs/PROGRESS.md` and stop that path.

## 4. Data and feature contract

Use the fixed bands:

- delta: 1-4 Hz
- theta: 4-8 Hz
- alpha: 8-13 Hz
- beta: 13-30 Hz

Legacy spectral AI is:

`AI = (P_left - P_right) / (P_left + P_right)`

The clean core graph channels are ordered:

`F3, C3, P3, O1, F4, C4, P4, O2`

The legacy spectral feature set contains exactly 19 `all_*` features: 16 AI features plus `all_pdBSI`, `all_DAR`, and `all_DTABR`. Subject IDs, NIHSS, severity, and epoch counts never enter a model matrix.

The planned v2 graph feature set has four metrics per band:

- `GlobalEff_absAI`
- `ClustCoeff_absAI`
- `MeanHomotopic`
- `FrobeniusDist`

## 5. Phase and subphase plan

### Phase 0: Reconcile and freeze the baseline

**Status: DONE for legacy work; v2 handoff reconciliation active.**

- **0.1** Verify the four legacy feature CSVs exist and have 50 subjects.
- **0.2** Confirm the legacy spectral benchmark and known graph epoch-count bias from the ledgers.
- **0.3** Keep `docs/archive/PROJECT_EXECUTION_GUIDE_V1.md` as historical reference only.

Gate: legacy inputs exist; v1 files are treated as immutable.

### Phase 1: A0 metadata audit

**Status: DONE for side semantics, subject mapping, and T3 feasibility under the prescribed contralateral assumption.**

- **1.1** Search repository and available data for `participants.tsv` and related metadata.
- **1.2** Record exact columns and source semantics for paralysis/hemiplegia side, lesion side, stroke location, age, sex, handedness, and onset.
- **1.3** Never infer lesion side from an undefined column. If only paralysis side is documented, explicitly map it as contralateral; otherwise mark semantics `UNVERIFIED`.
- **1.4** Create `docs/METADATA_AUDIT.md` and `features/v2/subject_meta.csv` with provenance and unresolved values.
- **1.5** Decide whether lesion alignment is feasible: verified semantics plus at least 10 clear left and 10 clear right lesion subjects. If not, mark T3 dropped and continue without lesion alignment.

Gate: passed for T3 feasibility. Figshare checksums authenticate the supplied files, the JSON defines paralysis side, all 50 source sides match subject metadata, and the prescribed mapping yields 22 left and 28 right derived lesion sides. The 800 lesion-aligned AI values and three globals match the prescribed construction. The TSV is version 5, not version 1; all 50 paralysis sides match version 1. See `docs/METADATA_AUDIT.md`.

### Phase 2: A1 absolute spectral table

**Status: DONE.**

- **2.1** Create `features/v2/spectral_abs.csv` from the 16 existing `all_AI_*` columns using absolute values.
- **2.2** Preserve the three global spectral features.
- **2.3** Create a sidecar with columns, definitions, source, hash, and the pdBSI redundancy check.
- **2.4** Validate 50 rows, 20 columns including `subject_id`, finite values, and no label columns.

Gate: acceptance checks passed; v1 files unchanged. The sidecar records a maximum mean(|AI|)-pdBSI difference of approximately 0.1124, so pdBSI is not treated as identical to the mean of the 16 subject-level absolute AIs.

### Phase 3: A3 channel, epoch, and design audit

**Status: DONE with provisional technical lock.**

- **3.1** Inspect epoch headers and channel names without reading clinical labels.
- **3.2** Calculate clean epoch counts, sampling rate, actual epoch window, per-channel 150 uV rejection rates, and losses under the expanded screen.
- **3.3** Reproduce the legacy graph epoch-count correlation as a label-free technical audit.
- **3.4** Select `N_fixed` using the guide rule: use the minimum if at least 15; otherwise choose the largest feasible value that excludes at most two subjects.
- **3.5** Select symmetric expanded pairs only when channel rejection rates are at or below 25%; retain the 8-channel core for G8f.
- **3.6** Write `docs/GRAPH_DESIGN_LOCK.md`, `configs/graph_g8f.json`, and `configs/graph_g24f.json`.

Gate: passed. G8f is primary with N_fixed=15; G24f is secondary with N_fixed=6 after the label-blind channel screen. Reopen the lock if implementation reveals a reproducibility or library-equivalence failure.

### Phase 4: A4 v2 graph library and tests

**Status: DONE for synthetic/unit validation.**

- **4.1** Create `src/graph_features_v2.py`; do not modify `src/graph_features.py`.
- **4.2** Cache per-epoch cross-spectra, calculate vectorized wPLI on sampled epochs, and aggregate median adjacency across subsamples.
- **4.3** Implement weighted global efficiency, Onnela clustering, homotopic connectivity, and aligned Frobenius distance.
- **4.4** Implement deterministic seed handling and explicit pair mapping.
- **4.5** Create `tests/test_graph_features_v2.py` using synthetic data only.
- **4.6** Verify symmetry, left/right invariance, reproducibility, `N_fixed` dependence, graph metric values, and wPLI equivalence or document a measured tolerance.

Gate: six graph tests, including the artifact-screen regression test, pass locally; three lesion-alignment tests also pass (nine total, 2026-10-19). Agrim approved the final snapshot on 2026-10-20; no additional AI/group review is required.

### Phase 5: A5 generation and A6 quality control

**Status: DONE WITH FLAGS; screen/sampling correction verified and final snapshot approved by Agrim.**

- **5.1** Generate `features/v2/graph_g8f.csv` and `graph_g24f.csv` with sidecars.
- **5.2** Add `n_epochs_g8f` and `n_epochs_g24f` to `subject_meta.csv`.
- **5.3** Log exclusions, runtime, and exact configs.
- **5.4** Write `docs/FEATURE_QC_V2.md` covering finite values, constants, ranges, epoch bias, second-seed stability, collinearity, and absence of labels.

Gate: the screen is now applied before spectra/subsampling, and its regression test passes. Group A regenerated the two 48-subject tables and updated QC and provenance. All 19 manifest entries match the local files exactly (2026-10-19). Full EEG regeneration was not repeated in this review. The user confirms input-location equivalence across computers; local reproduction still requires path mapping. Residual epoch-bias and seed-instability flags remain reportable limitations.

### Phase 6: Registry, freeze, and handoff

**Status: FROZEN at 42ff54d; interrupted primary run has verified T1-T5 and requires T6-T9/finalization.**

- **6.1** Group B freezes `docs/ANALYSIS_REGISTRY.md` before real-label evaluation.
- **6.2** Write `features/v2/MANIFEST.json` and `docs/FEATURE_CHANGELOG.md`.
- **6.3** Obtain Agrim's single project-owner review for the exact final digest.
- **6.4** Tag frozen tables `features-v2`; record hashes and handoff message.
- **6.5** Run the registry once, report all registered tests, and keep sensitivity analyses outside the registered claims.

Gate: frozen, hashed, reviewed outputs and a reproducible registry run.

Interruption recovery (2026-10-21): `src/continue_registry_v2.py` validates saved contracts, distributions, OOF folds/metrics and input/version identity, then invokes the unchanged frozen runner in a new directory. Completed test files are copied byte-for-byte; only missing tests are computed. The original run is preserved and a continuation provenance record documents reuse and the interruption reason. This changes execution recovery, not the registered scientific method.

### Phase 7: UCLH transfer and reporting

**Status: SOURCE AUDIT UPDATED; external NIHSS validation BLOCKED by clinical-target availability and raw-EEG/common-montage compatibility.**

- **7.1** Verify UCLH acquisition, preprocessing, clinical labels, and montage.
- **7.2** Build only a documented common-montage feature set.
- **7.3** Perform external validation only after Figshare v2 is frozen.
- **7.4** Report limitations: small sample, no severe class, task/rest mismatch, reference differences, missing or uncertain metadata, and any remaining epoch bias.

The 2026-10-20 pinned-source audit confirms 32 EEG channels plus STATUS, no O1/O2, and a 2 Hz high-pass in the source EEG extractor. The published participant table has no NIHSS column. Read `docs/UCLH_AUDIT.md` and `docs/UCLH_MONTAGE.md` before transfer; do not substitute stroke subtype for severity or a six-channel graph for the frozen eight-channel feature contract.

## 6. Required v2 outputs

Expected outputs, in order:

- `docs/METADATA_AUDIT.md`
- `features/v2/subject_meta.csv`
- `features/v2/spectral_abs.csv` and sidecar
- `docs/GRAPH_DESIGN_LOCK.md`
- `configs/graph_g8f.json`, `configs/graph_g24f.json`
- `src/graph_features_v2.py`
- `tests/test_graph_features_v2.py`
- `features/v2/graph_g8f.csv`, `features/v2/graph_g24f.csv` and sidecars
- `docs/FEATURE_QC_V2.md`
- `features/v2/MANIFEST.json`
- `docs/FEATURE_CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/ANALYSIS_REGISTRY.md` and registry results owned by Group B

## 7. Current blockers and decisions

- Figshare checksum verification and subject-level checks support T3 inclusion under the prescribed contralateral mapping. The supplied TSV is version 5; its 50 paralysis sides match the version 1 TSV. The mapping is an assumption and not direct imaging verification of lesion hemisphere; see `docs/METADATA_AUDIT.md`.
- `docs/CONTEXT.md` is the concise prompt-handoff document. This guide remains the operational authority.
- Group A corrected graph screening, regenerated graph outputs, enriched all four sidecars, and added the feature manifest, changelog and handoff. Local tests and manifest checks pass. The completed handoff is retained in `docs/V2_FEATURE_HANDOFF.md`; the current freeze state is tracked only in `docs/PROGRESS.md`.
- Local core-channel EEG checks reveal identical signals for subjects 4/5 and extremely similar signals for 11/15 and 47/49. The user's decision is to retain them as different subjects using the planned subject-ID splits. Report the possible dependence and train/test similarity as limitations.
- `docs/ANALYSIS_REGISTRY.md` specifies T1-T9 with statistical choices finalized before label evaluation. The authorized Option 3 amendment passed synthetic validation. Agrim is the sole project owner and the only required reviewer. The freeze guard reads one latest owner-review record bound to the final digest; historical AI/Group A reviews are not active dependencies.
- G24f is settled as secondary registered T6 in the nine-test Holm family (user authorization 2026-10-19); handoff and registry wording agree.
- B1 is frozen and B2/B3 are implemented. Gate A passed at p=.005; Gate B detected 168/200 moderate simulations (84%, within [50%,95%]). Synthetic acceptance is true and original failures remain documented. The frozen implementation's 32-test evidence remains unchanged; the expanded suite now passes 39 tests including the separately implemented descriptive sensitivities. Implementation state is consolidated in the technical ledger.
- The only active review record is `docs/reviews/registry_review.json`. Agrim approved the current snapshot on 2026-10-20 and authorized continued work, including the scoped freeze commit/tags and one-shot T1-T9 run. Verify the frozen content with the existing guard before evaluation; record all results and any failures.
- Freeze commit `42ff54d` now carries both annotated tags, `registry-v1` and `features-v2`. The real-machine guard passed for all 42 bound inputs before starting `primary_20261020`. BLAS/OpenMP thread counts are one for this run; all scientific settings are unchanged.
- The authorized exclusion-class disclosure confirms sub-13 (NIHSS 9) and sub-40 (NIHSS 6) are both moderate; graph subsets contain 33 mild / 15 moderate. The full-channel audit finds sub-04/05 identical on all 32 named signals, differing on the unnamed channel and in age/sex/location metadata; all paired stored metadata agrees with the source. The retained-ID policy is unchanged and dependence remains unresolved. See `docs/RECORDING_INTEGRITY_AUDIT_V2.md`.
- The legacy graph CSVs exist, but their epoch-count bias means they are a baseline, not the corrected graph solution.
- No severe-class model should be built from the current Figshare cohort.

## 8. Definition of done

The v2 track is complete only when the required outputs exist, acceptance checks and tests pass, all exclusions and unresolved metadata are documented, labels are absent from feature CSVs, configs and hashes are recorded, reviews are complete, `features-v2` is tagged, and `docs/PROGRESS.md` records the final handoff.
